# Lumague_A_Alphaprint
Alphaprint by PythonshellDebugwindow

This is an esoteric language created by PythonshellDebugwindow. This program reads a repeating series of ordered lowercase letters with some uppercase letters. The series of letters should start with "a". When a certain letter is uppercased, its nth order in the series is returned and the ASCII character it represents gets printed out. 

Example: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnOpqrstuvwX    Output: )2

From the example above, the output is ")2" because the capitalized letter: "O" and "X" are 41th and 50th letters in the series and 41 and 50 in the ASCII table are ")" and "2"
